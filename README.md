# [Jinja2++](https://ms-jpq.github.io/jinja2pp/)

Jinja2++ is a drop in single file solution for templating with **Variable Precedence**.

You can use **ANY language!**

## How it works

Based on the Unix pipeline : `JSON - stdin |> stdout - JSON`

A var_file is any executable that slurps JSON from STDIN, and spits JSON from STD out.

We assemble a series of cascading var_files based on the file hierarchy to overwrite proceeding variables.

We also do context injection, in the same fashion, ie context as the local path of each var_file / template, etc

## Features

### Variable precedence

```txt
src
|â”€â”€ vars.perl* <- [[base variables]]
â”œâ”€â”€ filters.py* <- inject ((J2 filters)) with ~vanilla python~ functions!
...
â”œâ”€â”€ render_inject.rb* <- inject && overwrite [pre-render context] variables
â”œâ”€â”€ var_inject.sh* <- inject && overwrite [pre-script context] variables
...
â”œâ”€â”€ monitoring/
â”‚  â”œâ”€â”€ grafana/
â”‚  â”‚  â”œâ”€â”€ templates/
â”‚  â”‚  â”œâ”€â”€ Chart.yaml.j2
â”‚  â”‚  â””â”€â”€ vars.js* <- [overwrite] variables here
â”‚  â”œâ”€â”€ iperf/
â”‚  â”‚  â”œâ”€â”€ templates/
â”‚  â”‚  â”œâ”€â”€ Chart.yaml.j2
â”‚  â”‚  â””â”€â”€ vars.fsi* <- [overwrite] variables here
â”‚  â”œâ”€â”€ prometheus/
â”‚  â”‚  â”œâ”€â”€ templates/
â”‚  â”‚  â”œâ”€â”€ Chart.yaml.j2
â”‚  â”‚  â””â”€â”€ vars.exe* <- [overwrite] variables here
...
```

### Dynamic J2 filter import

Write your filters as vanilla Python functions.

like so:

```python
def drop_first(lst):
  return lst[1:]


def base64(x, indent=0):
  encoded = str(b64.b64encode(x.strip().encode("utf-8")), "utf-8")
  return (" " * indent) + (encoded if encoded else "")
```

### Context injection

The following `[context variables]` will be injected before each var_file / template.

add more of your own!

```json
{"src": "...",
 "_dest_": "...",
 "_dir_": "...",
 "_parent_": "...",
 "_grand_parent_": "...",
 "_var_file_/_template_": "..."}
```

## Usage

Simply call `./j2pp.py` with the following:

**Note: For large projects you may need to call `ulimit -S -n <number>` to increase # of concurrent open files by a unix process.**

This is required prior to calling `./j2pp.py` due to the fact that it does parallel processing.

### Arguments

`--src`

Put all your .j2 templates here, along with var_files.

`--out`

Your finished templates go here.

`--exclude`

Any file paths in exclude will be skipped. i.e. --exclude .s .skip

`--var-files`

A VAR_FILE is an executable: .py, .sh, et al.
VAR_FILES are how you do variable injections.
JSON - stdin |> stdout - JSON.
VAR_FILES are placed in the file hierarchy
beween \*.j2 and SRC.
VAR_FILES closes to \*.j2 have higher precedence.

`--import-filters`

All functions in IMPORT_FILTERS will be included as
j2 filters. Must be python files.

`--inject-before-vars`

Same semantics as VAR_FILES,
except run before each VAR_FILE.

`--inject-before-render`

Same semantics as VAR_FILES,
except run before each .j2 file is rendered.

`--extra-vars`

Inject variables with JSON.
Highest precedence, also available to all var files.

`--delimiter`

Default is ðŸ¦„.
Any stdout in VAR_FILES before the last occurance
of ðŸ¦„ will be treated as comments.
ðŸ¦„ is entirely optional.

`--dry-run`

Just do a diff, dont write to file.

`--no-diffs`

Dont print diff.

`--formatter`

Used to print diff, if your terminal is kinda wonky,
pick one with less colours.
